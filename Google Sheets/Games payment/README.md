## Games payment

This project is about product metrics using Google Sheets and evaluating the effectiveness of user acquisition costs.

### Key features

🎯 In the file on the sheet we got from games.csv, added the following data columns:

✅ Total revenue - the sum of the revenue column for each game separately;

✅ Paid users count - the total number of paying users;

✅ CR to Paid - conversion from users to paid users as a percentage;

✅ ARPPU - average revenue per paying user;

✅ Average Age (paid users) - the average age of paid users;

✅ Median age (paid users) - the median age of paid users (calculated for all games in general, not for each game separately);

✅ Minimum age (paid users) - the minimum age of paid users;

✅ Maximum age (paid users) - the maximum age of paid users;

Below the table, a “Total” line has been added with the total values of each metric for all products at the same time.
The resulting table is formatted so that it is easier to understand for third-party users (or colleagues).

The conclusions are written below the table.

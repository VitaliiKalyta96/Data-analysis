## Data Analysis Projects

### Overview

These projects focuses on data analysis using multiple tools and techniques to derive insights from various datasets.

The goal ðŸŽ¯  is to explore ðŸ“ˆ , visualize ðŸ“Š and interpret data to support decision-making processes.

Tools Used: 

âœ… Google Sheets â€“ For quick data analysis and reporting.

âœ… SQL â€“ For querying and managing structured databases.

âœ… BiqQuery - A fully managed, serverless data warehouse by Google Cloud that enables fast SQL queries and large-scale 
data analysis.

âœ… Looker Studio â€“ For web-based data visualization.

âœ… Tableau â€“ For interactive data visualization and dashboards.

âœ… Amplitude - A product analytics platform that helps teams track user behavior, analyze engagement, and make data-driven 
decisions.

âœ… Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) â€“ For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

âœ… A/B testing to compare different versions of a feature or treatment and analyze the impact on user behavior or 
performance.

### Project Components

1. Data Collection - Collect data from multiple sources such as CSV files, databases, and APIs.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and structure data for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Use statistical summaries and visualizations to understand data patterns.

4. Data Visualization - Create charts, graphs, and dashboards to present key insights.

5. Insights & Decision Making - Interpret results and provide data-driven recommendations.

### How to run:

# Data Analysis Projects

## Overview

These projects focuses on data analysis using multiple tools and techniques to derive insights from various datasets. 
The goal is to explore, visualize and interpret data to support decision-making processes.

Tools Used:

✅ Google Sheets – For quick data analysis and reporting.

✅ SQL – For querying and managing structured databases.

✅ Looker Studio – For web-based data visualization.

✅ Tableau – For interactive data visualization and dashboards.

✅ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Components

1. Data Collection - Collect data from multiple sources such as CSV files, databases, and APIs.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and structure data for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Use statistical summaries and visualizations to understand data patterns.

4. Data Visualization - Create charts, graphs, and dashboards to present key insights.

5. Insights & Decision Making - Interpret results and provide data-driven recommendations.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/data-analysis-project.git

2. Install dependencies if required (for Python projects):

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

3. Open relevant files in Tableau, Power BI, or other tools for analysis.

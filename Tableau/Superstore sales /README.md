## Superstore sales 

This Tableau project analyses dataset-based data on order deliveries, focusing on key performance indicators such as the
average number of days it takes to deliver orders. The dashboard integrates filters that can be applied simultaneously 
to all the worksheets to provide dynamic insights into the dataset.

### Key Features:

âœ… Worksheet 1. The average number of days it takes to deliver an order for each type of shipping (Ship mode). The number 
of days for delivery is taken from the Order Date and Ship Date fields.

âœ… Worksheet 2. The number of orders is broken down by the number of days for delivery.

âœ… Worksheet 3. The average number of days it takes to deliver an order in each state in the United States, with 
visualization on a map and using a gradient. All sheets are added to the dashboard with appropriate filters: Order date, 
Segment, Ship mode.
